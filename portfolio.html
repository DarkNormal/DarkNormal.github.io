                                            <p>
                                                This project was a group of four assignment, to create a Java-based application with database interaction. A hotel management console was chosen as the operations developed would be applicable to many different situations.
                                                A database-first approach was adopted, however this changed to a code-first approach as there were a large number of model changes occuring regularly. My main activity was to focus on room / booking operations, the primary feature
                                                of the application. The application interacted with a local Oracle SQL database, where I used SQL queries and stored proceedures for many features. I also focused on improving the UX of the application, such as converting everything to a JPanels
                                                rather than JFrames with Java Swing. I received an A grade of 94% for the project. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/DarkNormal/Hotel-System-Project">here</a>.

                                            <p>
                                                As a group of 2, we developed an Android application to find nearby restaurants and reserve tables with an interface similar to flight, train and cinema tickets. This interface was built using various images of table types, which were saved to an
                                                Azure SQL database. Many integrations were included in the android apllication, including push notifications, email messaging service, Google Maps, and Google Calendar for saving reservations. The server backend for this project was developed in Node.js
                                                on Azure, which allowed the Android application to be fully distributed. Authentication was provided with many social platofrms such as Google+, Twitter and Facebook. A restaurant portal was also developed to register restaurants, manage bookings and
                                                add / change floorplans. This portal was made as an ASP.NET MVC web application, with Entity Framework used as data-persistence with the database and LINQ used throughout. Overall an A grade was award to this project.

                                            <p>
                                                During the summer I thought of some cool ideas for a new event orgainsing app, similar to Eventbrite and Meetup. After some experimentation with similar applications, I discovered that nothing with features I came up existed.
                                                The application, designed entirely to Material Design specs, will interact with a .NET web API that will perform much of the heavy-processing. Location-based algorithms will suggest the nearest or highest-rated venue for specific
                                                event-types, and the application itself will be entirely modular for the event organiser. Different features can be added for each event, which will make every event slightly different to the next - something which I criticised
                                                in relation to Facebook events. I'm currently in the early development stages of the project, but the source code and my progress can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/DarkNormal/ModernEventApp">here</a>.

                                                Through a contact I got in touch with Mike and David, who had just launched a new mobile app for finding the cheapest drink deals in shops and offlicenses. The website for promoting the application was already made with WordPress,
                                                however it was extremely basic and did not do a great job at marketing the application. I suggested some changes, took feedback from meetings with David, Mike and Gareth, and over the course of some months I completed the WordPress
                                                site for them. I used Photoshop to create higher quality mock ups and images for the site, and used my knowledge of WordPress to create an immersive and responsive website. The founders of MyDealDoc.ie were very happy with my work.

                                                The Garda Motor Club holds many events throughout each year, such as rallies, car shows, fundraisers and other race-types. I manage the website for the club, uploading documents and entry-forms, updating content, and managing the
                                                Facebook and Twitter accounts. This job is usually quiet for most of the year, but can become quite intensive around the time of events. I'm currently in the process of redesigning the website to use WordPress, and I will be building 
                                                a custom theme for the website. It currently uses a WYSIWYG editor provided by the hosting provider, but it only works on Mozilla Firefox. The site can be viewed <a href="http://www.gardamotorclub.com">here</a>.

                                            <p>
                                                When I joined IT Tallaght, I wasn't expecting a snowsports society. When I seen it, I immediately signed up and quickly moved up through the committee. eventually standing as chairperson. I designed and created a website for the
                                                society as the only point-of-contact was a Facebook Group page or email. Everyone really enjoyed the website, however I never made it responsive for reasons unknown to me. Maybe I didn't know how to back then as this was one of my first
                                                websites created entirely from scratch. I was very happy with the design and layout of the page, but the lack of responsiveness is disheartening. I might go back to it some day just to change it, however the society is not currently active so
                                                this is unknown. You can take a look at the website <a href="https://www.ittdsnowsports.ie">here</a>.

                                            <h4>Canal Café Vicarstown</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                A café opening in Vicarstown needed to generate some hype before opening as it's a relatively secluded area. I was commissioned to create an online presence for the café, so I created a website, TripAdvisor page, and a Facebook Page. I created the website using WordPress
                                                as the owner is not tech-savvy, so WordPress would be much easier to use for them. Using a restaurant-theme for WordPress, I customised the layout to suit the café style, and i took some images of the café to include on the page. After opening, some chages were required
                                                and some better images were taken, so I updated the site accordingly. The café is closed for the winter months, but it has been a success so far. The Facebook page has over 700 likes, the website is on page 1 of Google searches, and the TripAdvisor page has a 5 star rating.

                                By committing all the website files to a GitHub repository, a website can be accessed using GitHub Pages. The repository must be called your_github_username.github.io, and this will allow the website to be created.
                                This process is just as easy as using Azure, and somewhat better as it enables automatic source-control.

                                This site was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with various extras. Bootstrap was the primary framework for the website. I also used
                                FontAwesome for the icons which provides scalable icons. <br /><a href="this-website.html" target="_blank" class="link-no-pink">Read the full website breakdown here > </a>
